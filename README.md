# Orion Mesh Network

Welcome to the Orion Network Blockchain Project. This project leverages the NEAR protocol to create a decentralized and scalable blockchain network aimed at enhancing cybersecurity through an autonomous threat intelligence platform. Our network provides network-wide visibility of threats, utilizing advanced consensus mechanisms and smart contract capabilities to manage and respond to threats efficiently.

## Quick Start

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine as the network is containerized for ease of deployment and scalability.

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourrepository/orion-network.git
   cd mesh-blockchain-network
   ```

2. **Build and run the containers:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

This command will start all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, setting up the entire network on your local machine.
